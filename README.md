Key Concept

MVVM 
MVVM stands for Model - View - ViewModel
separate the task so make codes easier to understand & maintain & test

1. Model
   - data & business logic of the app
   - retrieving & storing data
   - process the data if it 

2. View
   - UI of the app (interact with user)

3. ViewModel
   - bridge between Model & View
      -> take data from the Model, applies UI logic and formats it for display in the view


MVVM : View Model
manager that handles the communication between app's data & UI
ALSO! respect(consider) the lifecycle of the app's activity or fragment while handling data

```kotlin
   class MyViewModel : ViewModel() { // extends ViewModel
       
       //
   }
```

```kotlin
   class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
       private val myViewModel : MyViewModel by viewModels() // usually initialized in an activity or fragment
   }

```

why is viewModel important?
1. lifecycle awareness : ViewModel is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way
It allows data to survive configuration changes (ex. screen rotations)


**[bulb emoji]tips1** 
without ViewModel pattern, variables are automatically initialized when configuration changes
this is because Activity or Fragment in android recreated when that kind of changes happen
: screen rotations -> old instance(activity/fragment) are destroyed -> new instance created -> all variables that old instance has are gone and new variables are initiallized with initial value

then how can viewModel keep the data?
ViewModel last longer than Activity/Fragment 
because it is stored inside the "ViewModelStore"(which is an storage in the memory) like Application instance)
and returned by "ViewModelProvider"

2. separation of concerns : 
ViewModel helps to keep UI code simple and focused on presenting data (ex. formatting.. )


**[bulb emoji]tips2**
- ViewModel is not a replacement for "onSaveInstanceState"; it doesn't handle all types of configuration changes
- ViewModel should never contains references to Views, Activities, Fragment or any Context( can lead memory leaks)

why mvvm?
1. separation of concerns
    - clear separation between UI/business logic/data
    - ensures that each components has a distinct responsibility(organized & easy to maintain)
2. testability
    - can test each component independently(test ViewModel without UI/data)
3. reusability
    - decoupled, can reuse the same view model across different views or platforms


Repository
Repository is a class that acts as a clean API for data access to the rest of the app(particularly when following the mvvm)
it abstracts origin of the data(where it came from)

various data sources(network sources, local db,web..) - repository - app(viewModel)
1)farm 2)market 3) ... - supplier - restaurant

if there is supplier between source and app
app doesn't need to care/know every time when sources it self/deliver method/etc are changed


why use repository?
1. decoupling : 
   - repository allow for decoupling of the data sources from the rest of the app.
   - ViewModel interacts with a repository, and it doesn't need to know where the data came from.
2. data aggregation
   - repository can manage and coordinate data from multiple sources, providing clean API(Application Programming Interfaces)
3. offline capability 
   - repository can cache network data (work offline)

   
Additional Info : APIs
APIs(Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules and protocols that allow one software application to interact with another.
(doesn't necessarily mean backend api) 
they define the methods and data formats that applications can use to communicate with each other

In simpler terms, API is a menu in a restaurant, request is an order, response is the dish that served to you
